##Statistical Analyses

We assess the average response time of emergency medical service by calculating the time difference between call and arrival across all neighborhoods in NYC. Upon looking at the profile of the response time all through the year, we carry out a log-transformation of the response time (// comment on use of box cox?)

Multiple linear regression models have been fit on to predictors such as time of day, day of week and weather to see the variation in log of response times. 

We carry out another hypothesis testing of the difference in the average response time within Upper West Side and Washington Heights. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not difference between the response times in the two neighborhoods

Alternate Hypothesis: There is.
