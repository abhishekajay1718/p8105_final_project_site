### Model

$$
\begin{aligned}
&logit(P(response\space time > 8 min))\\
&= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}I(season = Fall) + \beta_{2}I(season = Summer) + \beta_{3}I(season = Winter) \\
& + \beta_{4}I(hour\space of \space day = afternoon) + \beta_{5}I(hour\space of \space day = dawn) + \beta_{6}I(hour\space of \space day = morning) \\
& + \beta_{7}I(snow = 50mm+) + \beta_{8}I(snow = 50mm-) + \beta_{9}I(prcp = 25mm+) + \beta_{10}I(prcp = 25mm-) 
\end{aligned}

**Snow**
  As expected from EDA, compared to no snow conditions, odds of over 8min response time is increased 24% by 0~50mm snow and 47% by over 50mm snow.

**Season** 
  Compared to Spring, Summer does not affect odds of over 8min response time but odds is increased in Fall by 6% and in Winter by 7%. 

**Rain**
  Statistically significant result was not obtained from rain variable and it matches the result of EDA.

**Hour of the day**
  In reference to night, odds of over 8min response time is increased at dawn by 26%, in the morning by 37% and in the afternoon by 35%.
